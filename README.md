# Dermatology Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project contains a series of Python scripts designed to analyze and provide insights into various dermatological conditions, including psoriasis and steroid-induced acne.

## Files Included

- `psoriasis.py`: Contains analysis and insights related to psoriasis.
- `steroidacne.py`: Contains analysis and insights related to steroid-induced acne.
- `Question_1.py`: Perform DFT on input images of skin tumors and skin diseases, and display the reconstructed images from the frequency domain.
- `Question_2.py`: Apply low-pass and high-pass filters to skin tumor and skin disease images, and discuss the results.
- `Question_3.py`: Extract features related to skin diseases or tumors in the frequency domain and provide discussions about the findings.
- `Question_4.py`: Extract features using non-DFT methods and compare with DFT-based methods, providing discussions about the findings.
- `Question_5.py`: Bonus: Perform additional work to improve the results from Part II and provide detailed explanations and discussions.
